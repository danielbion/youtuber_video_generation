Create a Catchy Title (max 70 characters) that:
Summarizes the main benefit/curiosity
Includes 1–2 exact keywords
Avoids empty clickbait; deliver on the promise

Write the Description (make the first 2 lines highly compelling), that:
Quickly explains the content and what viewers will learn
Highlights clear benefits, short bullets, and proof/authority if available
Includes explicit CTA(s)
Naturally weaves in keyword variations

Generate Tags (15–20), comma‑separated, using:
Primary keywords, long‑tail variations, synonyms
Local terms when relevant (e.g., city, state, country)

Create Thumbnail Text (max 4 words), that:
Is mobile‑legible, high contrast
Reinforces the main hook/benefit without repeating the title

Optional: Suggest 2 title variations and 2 thumbnail variations for A/B tests.

Output format (do not change):
