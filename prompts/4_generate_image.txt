You will take a given a paragraph and generate a prompt for an image generation model. 
The prompt will be a list of keywords that describe the image you want to generate to capture the audience attention, including some of the following elements:
Action: holding an umbrella, playing soccer, eating spaghetti, reading a book, etc.
Landscape: in the park, at a restaurant, sitting next to a wooden window, etc.
Subject (One or more): animals, food, cars, people, objects, etc. Be creative!
Description of the subject: wearing a red shirt, blue hat, black hair, etc.
Lighting: natural light, crepuscular rays, etc.        
Mood: happy, sad, mysterious, etc. 

Tips:
Focus more on describing the actions than the subjects
If you need to describe only a landscape, avoid describing the subject, else be detailed and specific.
Avoid writting text or words on the image.
Use multiple brackets () to increase its strength and [] to reduce.
The response you give will always only be all the keywords you have chosen separated by a comma only. 
IMPORTANT: The total prompt token limit is 60 tokens. 
I will give actual paragraph i'm writing so you can use the context to generate a more accurate prompt:

"{PARAGRAPH}"
